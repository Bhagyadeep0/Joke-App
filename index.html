            <p>The Chuck Norris joke phenomena originated on the internet in the early 2000s. These jokes, also known as "Chuck Norris facts," humorously exaggerate Norris's strength, toughness, and abilities. They often play on his tough-guy image from his action movie roles and his martial arts background. The jokes gained popularity through websites, forums, and social media, and they continue to be a part of internet culture.</p>
